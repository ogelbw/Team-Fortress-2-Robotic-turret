# TeamFortress 2 Robotic turret
There have been multiple recreations of the engineer's turret from team fortress 2 however most of them are just static props or if they do have some form of movement it is usually just in one axis and on a repeating cycle. My aim with this project is to recreate the engineer's turret but also have it be able to track objects using a raspberry pi + camera and point the head of the turret at said objects mimicing the behavour seen in game.

I will leave all of the cad files and scripts for the turret in this repository so if you want to recreate this project you can. Please feel free to reuse/modify any of my work here to fit your own needs.

# Notes
Parts used for this project where mostly sourced by pieces I already had and so are probably not optimal, it may be better searching for better parts like using a raspberry pi 4 insead of 2 for faster processing.
